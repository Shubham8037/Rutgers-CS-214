step 1. 
In fileCompressor.c, it anaylizes the file structure using tokenize() function.
Here the file structure is:
	asst2/test/blah/text.txt
	asst2/test/yum.txt
step 2. 
According to that file structure, in tokenizer.c file, it reads the files and anaylizes each file.
Then it generates codebook for huffman code.

step 3.
The huffman code is generated in huffman.c file.

step 4.
After doing all file operations, the result is shown to test.txt file:
	asst2/test.txt
And according to loop functions, it only takes less than this runtime:
O(log n).
